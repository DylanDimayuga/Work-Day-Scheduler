# Work-Day-Scheduler
Created a Work Day Scheduler using HTML CSS and jQuery
Link to Live application [Work-Day-Scheduler] https://kuyadylan.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

This is a schedule used to input any important events going on during a user's work day. This schedule includes a little description on how to use it, the current date, and an input field for each hour of a 9-5 work day. Within each of the grey areas, text can be inputted into it, varying by user, and saved user the save me button at the end. This information will be stored in local storage so that when the page is refreshed, the text will stay on the page. The color of the input field also changes depending on the current time vs. the time on the scheduler. It will display grey if that hour has already passed, red if that hour is currently happening, and green if that hour has yet to pass.
